# Business Intelligence and Data Visualization for Algorithmic Trading Using a Data Warehouse

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to design and implement a data warehouse (DW) integrated with a Business Intelligence (BI) tool for visualizing stock market data and supporting algorithmic trading strategies. The system will process historical market data, calculate key technical indicators, and visualize trends to facilitate better trading decisions. The project will also include backtesting of trading algorithms to evaluate their performance over historical data. This project will provide traders with the ability to make data-driven decisions using dashboards and visualizations.

## Inception:
In recent years, algorithmic trading has become a dominant approach in financial markets due to its speed and data-driven nature. However, raw financial data can be overwhelming without a structured system to organize and analyze it. This project aims to address this problem by building a data warehouse to store structured historical stock data and provide BI-driven insights. Through visualizations of key indicators such as Moving Averages and RSI, traders will be able to identify trends and opportunities for profitable trades. The decision to proceed with this project is driven by the increasing demand for sophisticated tools that simplify financial data analysis and enhance decision-making in trading.

## Deliverables:
**Data Warehouse Design:** A schema and a fully implemented DW with stock market data.
**BI Tool Setup:** Dashboards and visualizations using Metabase to show market trends and indicators.
**Final Report:** A research paper using the IEEE Conference Template, detailing the projectâ€™s methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Conclusion:
This project will deliver a prototype that demonstrates how Business Intelligence tools can support algorithmic trading decisions. Through the design of a structured data warehouse and the integration of a BI tool, traders will have access to clear and actionable insights from financial data. The project will follow the timeline, and the budget remains minimal due to the use of open-source tools and free resources.
